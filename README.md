## Introduction
- A novel method for estimating monocular visual odometry that leverages RGB and metric depth estimates obtained through a phase mask on a standard 1-inch camera sensor.
- A depth-weighted loss function designed to prioritize learning depth maps at closer distances.
- Evaluation in zero-shot indoor scenes without requiring a scale for evaluation.

## Installation

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/naitri/CodedVO
cd CodedVO
```

### Environment Setup

```bash
 conda env create -f environment.yml
```

## Models

### Download Pre-trained Models
We provide our metric depth-weighted loss pre-trained model, which has been benchmarked on various indoor datasets.

## Dataset

### Download and Setup
We provide the training dataset, which includes the UMD-CodedVO dataset LivingRoom and NYU data, each containing 1000 images. The dataset also includes coded blur RGB images. 
- [Training data](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/12GrDxTBMaSlGeMRWycxmCQl01BHnC5-O?usp=sharing)

Additionally, we provide UMD-CodedVO dataset which includes ground truth depth, RGB images, coded blur RGB images, and trajectory information.

### Generate Coded Images
To generate coded blur RGB images from your own data, you can use the script `coded-generator.py`. 

```bash
cd scripts
python coded_generator.py --root /path/to/your/data --scale_factor YOUR_SCALE_FACTOR
```
- Scale factor for NYUv2 dataset is 1000, UMD-CodedVO-dataset is 1 and ICL-NUIM dataset is 5000.
- root path should be fodler contianing rgb, depth, Codedphasecam-27Linear. for e.g. ./datasets/nyu_data

Note: Our Point Spread Functions (PSFs) correspond to discretized depth layers using a 23×23 Zernike parameterized phase mask,with the depth range discretized into 27 bins within the interval of [0.5, 6] meters, with a focal distance of 85 cm.

## Training

### Train from Scratch
To train your data or our given dataset :
```bash
 python trainer.py --config MetricWeightedLossBlenderNYU --datasets /path/to/dataset/folder
```
- You can add different configurations for loss and depth space in config.py and use those configurations for training. In this example, we use MetricWeightedLossBlenderNYU for our pre-trained weight file.
- You can also change the training or test dataset in config.py by modifying lines 19-31.

## Evaluation
The evaluation script can be executed as follows:
```bash
python evaluate.py --CONFIG MetricWeightedLossBlenderNYU --DATASET /path/to/dataset/folder --OUTPUT /path/to/output/folder --CHECKPOINT /path/to/checkpoint/file
``` 

## Usage

### Run Visual Odometry
We use ORB-SLAM after disabling the loop closure. Predicted depth maps from the above models are used to compute the odometry. Follow the [ORB-SLAM2](https://github.com/raulmur/ORB_SLAM2) RGBD execution instructions. Note that we do not use coded blur RGB images directly. As mentioned in the paper, we apply [unsharp masking](https://www.mathworks.com/help/images/ref/imsharpen.html) on them for computing odometry.
